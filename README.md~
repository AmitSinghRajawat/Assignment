How to test the app:

1. Go to python-getting-started/hello/views.py.
2. In the index method, variable "gitUrl" is initialized with "https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues" for testing purpose.
Replace it with your own testing url.
3. Re-launch the app.

App-Name: guarded-island-9449
URL: https://guarded-island-9449.herokuapp.com/

Improvements Scope:

1. We can create Textfield UI can be created as a app-home-page.
2. Input the URL from textfield rather than changing source code files.
3. Instead of simple plain text we can use django template for better representation of info.
